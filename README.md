# Learning JavaScript Promises by Example

This repo features several working examples of JavaScript Promises and composition functions of the Promise object.

To use this:

1) Clone or download this repo locally
2) Open `index.html` in your web browser
3) Open your browser's developer tools
4) Click on an example's button to execute it
    * observe the results in your browser console

These example correspond to my presentation **This is a Promise That You'll Understand Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript**.
